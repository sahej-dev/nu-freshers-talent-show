# NU Freshers Talent Show
This repository contains all the code presented in my presentation at the 2020 Freshers Talent Show at NIIT University.

__NOTE:__ The incomplete versions of the softwares is just the commented out full, finished version. This was done so I did not have to write multiple iterations of the same program with minor changes, again and again for the presentation.

## How to Run on Your Own Machine?
### Rain Simulation:
Each iteration of the project has a folder named *vc2019*, which contains a Visual Studio 2019 Project. Just open it and hit run in Visual Studio 2019. An installer for the finished version for windows is also available <a href ="https://github.com/sahej-dev/nu-freshers-talent-show/tree/master/Rain_Simulation/Setup">here</a>.

### Sine Waves:
Just open *index.html* in a web browser.

### Typing Robot
It is an IntelliJ IDEA project. You will probably have to setup PATH for OPENJDK11 and JavaFX in your IDEA installation to run it.
